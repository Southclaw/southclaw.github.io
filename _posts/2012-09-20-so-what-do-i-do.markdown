What do I do? Well, besides frequent guitar playing, gaming, college and hanging out one of my main hobbies is SA:MP, I mentioned this in the first post.

I do more programming than playing! But I enjoy it a lot, it's like a mind game or a brain exercise trying to make code run as fast as possible in the best way to give the best results to the end users (the players on a server I script for). How do I do that you might ask? Well, maybe I should back up a bit...

_The Pawn language was developed by CompuPhase._

SA:MP uses a scripting language, what is a scripting language? At the most basic level it's what the name suggests, a language, more specifically one to help humans communicate with programs, tell them what we want and how to do it. But it's not anything like learning Spanish (Which I did at GCSE level, forgot most of it now) computer languages are all based on logic and mathematics. If you are looking to start learning any form of machine code and don't have any idea where to start, I highly recommend starting out with SA:MP, all you need is an 8 year old PC game (GTA: San Andreas, which you can probably pick up from a game shop or on the net for a couple of pounds) and the SA:MP client+server (Which is a free mod). SA:MP uses the the Pawn scripting language which is very similar to C, it's quite easy to create simple scripts with and very user friendly. There are many tutorials out there as well as great resources such the as [SA:MP wiki](http://wiki.sa-mp.com/) and [forum](http://forum.sa-mp.com/usercp.php) sites. The wiki has a complete library of functions and other things you'll need and the forum has many tutorials (some good, some bad) also don't forget you are welcome to Email me for minor help too! I will also use this blog to post about things I've made, I spend a lot of free time just messing around coding random things (_This is the best way to learn!_) and I usually make short videos showcasing them which can be found on my [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/SouthclawJk). If you just play SA:MP, come visit me on my server or at the [Empire Bay community](http://forums.empire-bay.com/)! ~Southclaw :)
