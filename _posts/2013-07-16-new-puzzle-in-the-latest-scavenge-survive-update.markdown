Activities like puzzles are a rarity in SS, despite being listed as one of the top attractions/features of the game. This is not because I'm lazy! I just seem to spend more time fixing bugs and working on the internal framework of SS rather than actually _creating content _such as puzzles and new areas to explore. But I am slowly but surely adding in interactive activities in the environment for players to work together in order to complete! ![](http://teambuilding.firebirdevents.co.uk/images/treasure-hunt.jpg) This new puzzle isn't really a puzzle, it's more of a _treasure hunt_ for the required items to get into an area. Yes, an SS activity that involves _searching for things_ as if there isn't enough of that already, I know! But it's something in between now and whenever I figure out what the next actual puzzle will be.

## **Inspiration**

The idea came into my head when I was playing Killing Floor (a damn good game) with some friends, on an objective map there are 50 figurines hidden around the map (some in bizarre places!) which you have to find before the game ends, which just took ages once we got down to about 20 remaining figurines. I have also been playing the most recent Tomb Raider from Square Enix (fantastic game, review coming soon!) which also involves searching for various items in the game world in order to get achievements. I felt that I could just add 50 things around the map ready to find that don't offer any reason, especially in SS, so I had to add an incentive and reward.

## **How it works**

In each zone (currently just SF, more on the way soon for each of the 7 zones) there is a secret area accessible only by entering a code onto a keypad. Now, you could actually sit there all day typing every combination of 4 digit numbers not starting with a zero (8999 combinations) or you can search for the answer! There are 4 items, named simply "Code" hidden around San Fierro, there are 10 possible locations for these items each of which has one digit of the keycode visible when you view it in your inventory (the number will be in brackets next to the item name) All you have to do once you found all the items is input the code in the right order, that's right you still have to get the order correct before you can open the door! 

## 

## **It's all worth it though!**

Inside this secret room is **4 survivor loot spawns at 25% spawn rate!** You may not actually get anything, but that's unlikely, probability states at least one of the loot spawns will create items (each spawn contains up to 3 items)

## Good Luck!

The update will go out soon after this post is up!
