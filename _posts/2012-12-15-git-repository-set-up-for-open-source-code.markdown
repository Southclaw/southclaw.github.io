I've set up a Git repo for all my scripts (filterscripts, gamemodes and other frameworks/APIs/Includes etc) It's a great tool for all sorts of coding whether you're working on a massive project with loads of contributors or just a small solo project. It also has paid services which offer private repositories for teams but the free versions forces open source, which is fine by me as I love to share! ![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/GitHub.svg) You can find my repository here: [github.com/Southclaw/samp-Hellfire](github.com/Southclaw/samp-Hellfire) For those of you who don't know, Git is what's known as a "Version Control System" it tracks changes made to code, backs up previous versions and makes shared development a lot easier (I'm still working solo though) How it works: When the main developer makes a change to some code, he can open up the Git windows application which will be set up to his Github account, select the project and "commit" a new build, this submission goes with a commit message and optional description that describes to viewers of the repository what the change has done. These are all saved in a global history that lists all changes since the project was first created. Other users can then "fork" a project, this means they get a clone of the code to edit themselves and make their own version of. Users can submit fixes to the master (owner) and he can decide whether or not to add the fix to the main build.
