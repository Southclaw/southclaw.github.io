This has been going around a lot lately, and I recently saw [this post](http://forum.sa-mp.com/showthread.php?s=86135e76c4b0ef82491b9d3fe7b0334b&t=455222) by Mauzen and thought I would post my thoughts here (since my account is banned) It seems the majority of feedback on this is negative (however the majority opinion will almost always be negative as the positive thinkers have no reason to speak out) but anyway, there are a handful of general opinions on this, including the extremely paranoid "the NSA is watching our EVERY move" to the extremely laid back "I've got nothing to hide". ![](http://i.imgur.com/AHGq8jI.png) Personally, I really don't have an issue with it but like I said 'personally', as Mauzen said "The problem isn't being spied personally, but the nsa violating essential laws of privacy worldwide" which is true. If you're just some average joe who uses the internet for general reasons (forums, gaming, the odd torrent) I really doubt a team of analysts are hired to spy on specific people (there are a lot of people spewing out a lot of data!) The other point I wanted to bring up is that this kind of data really does help in investigations and intelligence. Need phone recordings of a possibly terrorist? Already got them! The fact is, people don't actively **listen in** to _every_ single person in real time, which seems like what a lot of people are thinking. To my SA:MP server manager friends out there, imagine trying to administrate a SA:MP server without spectate commands, or the ability to retrieve IP addresses or country data. It would be a tough job! However, I'm not all _for_ the concept, it still violates privacy laws. Despite the fact I believe tools like this are necessary for governments, especially in this digital age, I still think there should be some limits and disclosure to the public about these things. ![](http://mauzen.org/img/xkpos.jpg) One last thing, that image is all the locations of data centre sites across the globe, Mauzen brought up a point that I was also thinking about, what are the dots to the south that are all lined up about? It is odd that they are almost perfectly lined up! Ocean platforms? Underground (unlikely!) bunkers? [Floating sky bases](http://www.rijhwani.org/~raj/images/CS-Cloudbase_2.jpg) filled with hard drives? Anyway, that's my two cents, to be honest I don't really know a great deal about the recent events with Snowden and the NSA, mainly because I have bigger things to worry about and I don't think it will affect me in any way whatsoever!
