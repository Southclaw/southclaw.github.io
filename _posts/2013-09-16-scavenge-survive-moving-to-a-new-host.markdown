Thanks to the awesome [Empire Bay Gaming](http://forums.empire-bay.com/), the Scavenge and Survive server is moving to a brand new host machine with nicer specs. That means better connection, more responsive interaction, less ping kicks/random disconnects for the most part! 

# **IP: 94.23.19.43**

(Random relevant internet picture)![](http://i.imgur.com/XoqcyV9.jpg) Another nice thing is the SS server will now occupy the default SA:MP port (7777) so there's less to type in for new players, meaning the server can be accessed just by knowing the IP or domain (samp.empire-bay.com, not sure if this is updated yet) Now that the server is more stable, advertisement and promotion will start happening. I am confident that it can spring back up to the 20-30 player count it was a while ago! In the near future, I'll be posting promotional material I have created for the server, which can be plastered on various networks around the web!
