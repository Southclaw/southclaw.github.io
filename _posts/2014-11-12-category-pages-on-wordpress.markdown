Here's a quick post outlining some small changes I've made to the PHP code on my university WordPress 4.0 site which students use to document course work. I originally wanted a very organised site where I could store posts of different types (course strands in most contexts) in separate pages and still leave the main page as a full feed of all my content. Pages, unfortunately didn't offer this behaviour by default as they only displayed a pre-set (static) piece of content.  I decided to delve into a language I've rarely touched on on a platform I've never even read the API documentation for! After a couple of hours of work and Wordpress codex browsing, I have exactly what I want.

The idea here is that, if a page is named after a category then it will display all the posts in that category (as well as whatever content the page body text contains). Firstly, the page name is stored into "$catname" on line 33. After this, a check ensures the category is valid (a [return of 0](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_cat_ID#Return_Values) means it's not a valid category) and this allows pages to be created that aren't only titled after categories. Now we know the category is valid, a query can be created and run based on the ID on line 39. A while loop runs through the posts and gathers the content. The next part is copied from content-single.php and it simply formats an excerpt instead of a full post (which is what get_template_part('content', get_post_format()); does, that's what I was using at first). Finally, the comments, footer and other stuff is inserted and the page is complete! To me, the code looks extremely ugly (PHP always does...) with all the open/close tags. But at least it works! Pretty good for a first try...
