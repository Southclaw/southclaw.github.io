I've finally added a releases page that lists all the stuff I've made and finalised for public use (At the moment it's just SA:MP stuff) So far, each item has links to either a SA:MP Forums release topic from back when I had an account or a GitHub/Gist page with the latest commit in the repository. Eventually I will write up a release post for each item here on the blog where I can keep everything updated properly! (Some of those SA:MP forum topics are really out of date and I really want to get them updated ASAP!)
