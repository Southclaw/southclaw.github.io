In case you didn't notice the announcement on the Empire Bay forums; on Dec 24th I shut down the server and left the project. Don’t worry, it’s back online under new management so you can still play however there won’t be any updates for a while.

# Why Is The ~~Rum~~ Server Gone?

Among others, the main reason for this is that I don’t have enough time to manage the server and develop it. I am confident to say that Scavenge and Survive is one of the most difficult servers to staff and monitor for hackers. This is for two reasons:

##### 1\. Hack programs can be used to their full advantage

In a racing server, a speed hack is easily detected. In a deathmatch server a health hack is very easily detected. In a base-building survival game it’s virtually impossible to figure out if someone can see nametags, or using a wallhack, or teleporting 0.1m through a player-built defence to steal their items. Admins have to observe player behaviour and judge for themselves if a player looks like they unfairly know the locations of others, but then again it can always be a complete fluke. When latency is brought into the equation, a lot of the methods used to check if a player is walkthrough through 0.1m thick walls become useless.

##### 2\. Staff powers can be very easily abused

As mentioned before, admins must watch players all the time using the spectate feature. Unfortunately this means those admins can’t fairly engage in a chase or combat with those players or they will be abusing their knowledge that was gained from an administration tool. It can be done accidentally too, a report comes in about teleporting and suddenly you know their coordinates. If the report was false due to lag and that player stays online, the admin involved must not use that knowledge to their advantage.

# What Next?

In the coming weeks, I will publish a full postmortem of the project in it’s first year (think of it as a year-in-review type document) and after some time I will likely return to a slower development schedule and fix some of those nasty bugs. For now, the source code is - as always - available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Southclaw/ScavengeSurvive) for you to delve into and explore.

# In other news…

I have many projects on the table, as always!

  * This Blog! - I really want to post more often, but I have no idea what the audience is! There are views but no comments so I guess I’ll just keep posting whatever pops into my head.
  * [SwizzIncludes](https://github.com/Patrik356b/SwizzIncludes) \- Collaboration between me and Patrik356b/Hexile. A ‘Swizz Army Knife’ for SA:MP with tons of useful functions and data structures.
  * [SIF/SIF-Nightly](https://github.com/Southclaw/SIF) \- My interaction framework, I plan to strip out the dialog system and replace it with a nice flexible text-draw UI.
  * [Y_Less’ YSI](https://github.com/Y-Less/YSI) \- Every now and then I help document a bit of this on the YSI Wiki. Once SIF is stable, I plan to ask Y_Less if he’s up for merging SIF into YSI so it’s more accessible.
  * [College Game](https://github.com/Southclaw/PresEvil) \- A silly little parody game called President Evil which a small team of college friends and I are working on.
  * [DeviantArt Portfolio](http://southclawjk.deviantart.com/) \- More time spent art-ing nowadays. Both traditional and digital which is enjoyable, I only wish I had more time for this.

Goodbye (for now...)
