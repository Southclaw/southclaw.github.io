Survival has been the buzzword of the games market these past few years; since the popularity of Minecraft and the DayZ mod, it has become a common selling point for many titles (even those that differ greatly from the actual survival genre) Square Enix's reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise is no exception. However, despite this, the game itself is very enjoyable with some impressive graphics.

![Alt TombRaider](http://i.imgur.com/85zOgFVl.jpg) Lara's adventure is far from survival gameplay wise but that's what the story is based around. The game itself is honestly pretty fun; gunplay is rewarding though a tad easy on the highest difficulty. Much of your island activities involve holding a gun or a scavenged bow from early in the game. 

# Mechanics

There is a subtle cover system, it works when it needs to and doesn't get in the way at all. Changing the camera side from right to left is a button click away and happens automatically for wall cover which is useful. The gunplay is so smooth and enjoyable that they may have gone overboard with the sheer quantity throughout the missions; I found myself getting a little bored and craving the well-designed puzzles that I grew to love about this series. 

# Puzzles

That's the biggest problem with this game. The side-mission type puzzles are really enjoyable but they are just that, side-missions. There are a handful of vital story areas that don't require shooting people but the more traditional Tomb Raider tombs that require a bit of thinking to get around are hidden away down holes (well not exactly hidden I'll talk about that shortly). Which is a real shame, because I thoroughly enjoyed the well-made puzzles; despite being a little easy, the addition of physics and fire as core elements really made them fun. 

# Difficulty

Now, let's talk about difficulty. I've played through the entire game once and got 100% completion on the hardest difficulty and it just didn't feel difficult at all. Finding tomb missions wasn't difficult as they weren't really hidden (apart from a few) and backtracking some levels for missed collectables was more arduous than difficult and the x-ray-vision-like “survival instinct” feature (much like the “instinct” feature of Hitman Absolution) just makes it easier; I avoided using this until the end when I was just running for collectables. In terms of combat, the enemy AI can be challenging and fun to play against. Sometimes, outsmarting them wasn't hard and other times they seemed to have me pinned down pretty well. I noticed this seemed linked to the complexity and layout of the areas. 

# Story

The story was enjoyable. It flowed with the game well but it isn't anything special. It makes an effort to break away from the classic castaway plotline with the addition of a tribal band of shipwrecked maniacs fighting against some ancient Japanese civilisation who just so happen to be searching for a girl who looks rather similar to Lara's best friend. It has its twists and turns along the way; I wouldn't play it just for the story but it acts as a nice container for all the gameplay to happen and make sense in. 

# PC Performance

As this is a PC review, a look at performance is mandatory. I ran this on a GTX650Ti and an i7-2600 with 8GBs of RAM. Not the most beastly setup but the game was running at a consistent 40-50FPS on the highest settings during gameplay. The only time the game started to drag a bit was the cutscene close-ups of Lara with her physics simulated hairdo. 

# Conclusion

In conclusion, this was a fun game, it really was. And I'd happily go back and play it again sometime. I just think it falls short of some of the core elements that made the Tomb Raider series so enjoyable and memorable (like, oh I don't know Actually Raiding Tombs?) But in Squenix's defence, they were doing something fresh and new with the series and I admire that. It's been confirmed that the studio are working on a follow up title which I am glad to hear. This series certainly still has the survival instinct.
