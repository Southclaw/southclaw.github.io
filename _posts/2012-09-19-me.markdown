I'm Barnaby also known as Southclaw by the internetters out there, I am studying _Games Development Level 3_ at _Confetti Institute of Creative Technologies_ in Nottingham for two years.

Video games are a passion of mine, as a child I wasn't introduced to video games as young as most people but when I first saw 3D rendered images I became fascinated as to how that all works, how you get a real object and put a 3D image of it onto a computer screen.

Some old favourites include (Earliest first if I remember correctly): 

  * Star Wars X-Wing Alliance (PC) (I was a _MASSIVE _star wars geek as a kid! (still am))
  * Black And White (PC) (Throwing people around, having a giant pet tiger? Best game.)
  * Roller Coaster Tycoon (PC) (My first game I had on my very first own computer!)
  * Wargames (PS1)
  * Spiderman (PS1)
  * Oddworld (PS1)
  * Myst (PC)

However the game (or series) that stood out most in my gaming life is Grand Theft Auto. GTA is an incredibly moddable game, I don't know if the developers intended for it to be but the data files are not encoded, they even have instructions on how to edit some values and what they do!

I soon discovered SA:MP, the multiplayer mod, after my favourite server shut down I decided I would learn how to run my own using the SA:MP API that allows creation of customized game types. I started learning _Pawn_, a 32-bit typeless C style scripting language.

It's about 3 years since that, I love to help out people in the SA:MP community in the same way a lot of great people helped me in understanding how programming actually works. Once I got the hang of the logic of programming it became a simple task of learning all the functions that were available to use in scripts.

Oh and Just Cause 2 Multiplayer will have an API so expect me to dive into that too! Thanks for reading! ~Southclaw :) [![](http://i.imgur.com/fOzwr.png)](http://i.imgur.com/fOzwr.png) Oh and I also love playing around with digital graphics and 3D modelling, like above!
