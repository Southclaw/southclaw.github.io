I have finally finished all the loot spawns for the world (8442 in total!) so very soon the SS server will undergo some changes in the transition from Beta testing phase to full release. Most notably, a character and world reset to allow everyone to start from scratch. [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2tAR0iCFN8]  As well as this, the full release will also be timed with some promotional content such as advertisements and videos posted around the web to hopefully get some more players interested! Don't worry, after the full release stage, I will still be working on developing the game more, I'll just be working on different aspects of the game such as content like puzzles and new areas, as oppose to gameplay mechanics and new features. The music I used in the video, it's by Flashworx and the track is called Futurisma, all credits to that really great band, [you can find the full track here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcOiJnWniWg), and their [soundcloud here](https://soundcloud.com/flashworx), if you're into new wave electro style music, check them out!
