I recently had this creative explosion somewhere in my brain, as a result of that I’ve been drawing a lot, both on paper and digitally! This was a result of a number of things, most notably the fact that I finally finished a large part of my ongoing Scavenge and Survive project (The previous post has more info on that) because of this I decided to take a little break from programming and try something new for once (it was also thanks to a rather motivational video I saw from Drift0r, a youtuber I watch regularly)

Anyway, during this creative explosion I managed to produce this digital remastering of someone elses sketch: ![](http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/240/9/a/wolfox__transparent_png_version__by_southclawjk-d6k3iah.png) I can't stress that enough _I didn't draw this!_ I merely took the original sketch ([from this awesome artist right here](http://vaporotem.deviantart.com/art/Wolf-2967207)) re-drew it myself and then coloured it in and tweaked it a bit! I'm pretty damn proud of the result and it’s made me feel really great! Here's the original sketch: ![](http://fc07.deviantart.net/images/i/2003/37/d/6/Wolf_.jpg) And here's an alternate version I made where he's a bit angrier! ![](http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2013/238/2/a/wolfox_is_angry__by_southclawjk-d6ju5ka.png)

# Drawing

So, now that I've started, why stop? I spend most of my drawing time (which is hardly any time) drawing weapons, I never really finish them and they end up as scrap sketches. So now I want to start exploring more organic subjects such as animals. Last time I tried humans it didn't turn out too well! I really like cats, wolves and foxes so I think those will be my main focus for practice, which will involve studying the anatomy, shapes, stances of them. I love it so much, I set up a DeviantArt page for uploading drawings etc: <http://southclawjk.deviantart.com/>

# Music

My hobby wasn't the only thing that is undergoing changes, previous to this I really wanted to listen to some new music as I hadn't had a new band to listen to since The Guess Who (which I discovered about a year ago!) now I **love** old music, that 70's and 80's rock and roll is just perfect but it had gotten a little stale after days of coding with constant music on. A friend sent me some links to some very 80's style electro music (no idea of the actual genre, I'm terrible with genre names...) that I just loved! Here's an example: [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcOiJnWniWg] (Check out the channel [NewRetroWave](http://www.youtube.com/user/NewRetroWave) if you like what you hear) Now aside from an awesome video from a movie I am yet to watch (but will do, it's called Akira, an early Japanese anime movie from 1988) the music was just the change I needed to break my routine and get into something new. Other artists I've listened to recently include: Lazerhawk, ActRazer, Lifelike, Miami Nights 2984, Kavinsky and Electric Youth) So if you're feeling a bit down with a monotonous routine (such as programming!) take it from me to just try something new, or revisit something you never finished or always wanted to do! Coming from the guy who spent the last 3 years learning to program and programming nothing but San Andreas Multiplayer mods, this is probably not surprising!
