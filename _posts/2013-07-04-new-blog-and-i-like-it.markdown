So, I used to use Blogger, it was nice but I started using it for college assignments too much and wanted a separate one just for personal things. I tried out Tumblr, because I had heard a lot of good things from various people about it, I really thought it was going to be great with custom editing of themes through CSS and HTML. Alas, it just didn't cut it for me, I don't know why really, it just didn't seem like my thing. So I decided to try wordpress and so far I love it! I found a theme I like instantly unlike the other two services where none really caught my eye. Not to mention the page feature (Not sure if this is available in the other two hosts I mentioned), I can really keep things organised now and start doing code releases and other things. Anyway, I shifted all my posts over and will be posting here (hopefully more often!) from now on! ~Southclaw :)
