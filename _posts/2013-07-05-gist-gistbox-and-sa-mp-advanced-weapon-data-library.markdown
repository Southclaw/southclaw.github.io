Github has this this really cool service called Gist, it's sort of in between GitHub repositories and Pastebin, and it goes really well with Sublime Text and a web app called GistBox! Gists are actually repositories, but sort of thinned down versions, you can paste multiple files to one Gist repo just like a GitHub repo but there's no folder structure so it's ideal for nice simple sets of files or just single files like Pastebin. Unlike GitHub repositories, Gist gives users the ability to make these repositories private without the need for a paid account which is very handy. I've recently moved my Advanced Weapon Data library for SA:MP over to Gist, because Gists are repositories I can have full control over tracking versions, as well as the fork feature in case someone wants to make their own version. You can get your hands on this library and find out more at this link: <https://gist.github.com/Southclaw/5934397> The next item on the agenda is GistBox, a handy Chrome app and website that offers easy management of Gists as well as social sharing options. A nice feature I can see myself using a lot is the ability to organise Gists into categories. Overall, this app is very handy, the scroll bar for viewing files is a tad small and is hard to see when viewed on a maximised monitor but luckily it supports any Chrome scrolling extension just fine (I use [Chromium Wheel Smooth Scroller](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromium-wheel-smooth-scr/khpcanbeojalbkpgpmjpdkjnkfcgfkhb?hl=en)) I may do more mini-reviews of the software I find...
