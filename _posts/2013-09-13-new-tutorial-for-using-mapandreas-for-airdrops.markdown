A request from "Flow420" via the tutorials feedback form. This one covers the basics of creating an airdrop and using MapAndreas to retrieve a Z axis position for any X-Y position on the map, meaning the airdrop can be dropped anywhere and will land in the correct location! Check out the tutorials section on the navigation bar, the new one is listed when you mouse-over. Remember, I'm always up for writing tutorials, for large things use the feedback form and for small queries just Email me or comment on the tutorials page!
