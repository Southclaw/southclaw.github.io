I finally played the Beta today with a couple of friends (I've had it since it came out but never got time to play) and it's a bit different from what I expected! I enjoyed my time playing but still have a few issues with the game. I'll try keep this short and sweet though, as I need to break the habit of posting walls of text! ![](http://thecontrolleronline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Battlefield-4-logo.jpg) Now I will be talking about gameplay mechanics not performance issues. Performance has been a very noticeable issue in my experience but it's expected in a Beta test. I refrained from writing a HUGE wall of text to make it easier to read! Just read the bits you want to know about, if you haven't played it and want to know something just drop a comment asking me and I'll answer as best I can! 

# **The Good**

  * ## **Improved Destruction**

Destruction is really fun! It feels more like how it was in the Bad Company games. I can't really judge this properly however, as there's only one map available and it's very urban. The map is very nice though, there are a lot of neat little things like a button that closes shop shutters or elevators that take you up various buildings (not just the one that falls down, I think I counted 2 other elevator buildings)
  * ## **Not Too Similar to BF3**

It really looks like BF3, but only aesthetically. Similar textures but that's only because the same studio! Overall it's more of a change than I expected from screenshots and videos. It _looks_ like BF3 but it plays a lot better.
  * ## **Weapon Mechanics**

The weapons seemed less clunky than BF3, especially reload animations and aim speeds. I really like the new dual-scope too; it's one of my favourite attachments on Black Ops 2.
  * ## **Movement Mechanics**

Movement feels a lot more fluid and smooth. I swear it's faster than BF3 but maybe that's because I turned the FOV up to 120 (that was pretty fun!) the jumping definitely needs work though. I vaulted a few objects and it glitched up a bit; however I couldn't find any jumpable objects that were as bad as those ones in BF3 that just rejected vaults despite being obviously low enough to vault.
  * ## **Available Settings**

I'm colourblind, more specifically I have the protanopia branch of colourblindness. I think BF4 is the first game to offer different colourblind settings for different types of colourblindness! There is a setting for each type: Deuteranopia, Tritanopia and Protanopia. As well as this, there is a FOV slider that goes from 70 to 120 (120 is REALLY fun and gives you a great sense of awareness, however it can mess your eyes up a bit as objects on the edges of the screen look REALLY close then you turn to look at them and they are suddenly far away!)



# **The Bad**

  * ## **HUGE Collision Issues**

This is an issue I noticed in the past 3 games from dice. Your soldier is too fat to fit through gaps that are obviously large enough. Yes, I know a soldier has lots of gear on but in real life you will squeeze your way through smaller gaps even with gear on, because in real life you aren't rigid all the time! Another problem with collisions is the small objects on the floor. I'm talking about tiny boxes, luggage, tires and all that garbage. They all have oversized collision boxes that stop you from moving so you have to jump! This gets pretty annoying especially now the game is more fast paced. In real life I would simply trample on top of a cardboard box not jump over it! I also noticed some TINY raised floors on the insides of shops, I'm talking about floors raised about 10CM or less that stop a hardened soldier in his tracks. These NEED to be fixed before release Dice!
  * ## **Vehicles Don't Seem as Fun**

Maybe it's just me, vehicles were really fun in the Bad Company games. I don't really know exactly what it is about BF3+4 that put me off vehicle combat. I think it was because in BC2, vehicles played a more special role. They weren't seen as much but when they were, they were a challenge. In BF3+4 they just seemed pretty easy to take out and no threat whatsoever. This goes the same for air vehicles. Again, in BC2, the helicopters were like these super dangerous iron birds that rained down terror and death from the skies. Me and my friend _really_ had to work to take one out and when we did it felt awesome! The dart gun and lack of lock-on rocket launchers was a great idea and I felt it balanced the game pretty well. In BF3+4, I see a helicopter and it's no problem, I just whip out my AA-launcher and it's pretty much dead.
  * ## **There are So Many... THINGS!**

Maybe I'm just getting old. There's so much stuff in the game. First you've got the metric ton of weapons and attachments (no issue here, I love this amount of content!) but then on top of that there's this squad perk thing, something called "boosts" that I noticed in the loading screen, "battlepacks". The game UI is nice but it feels a little cluttered. All this stuff affects balancing and makes it a harder job with all these factors affecting players. I may be wrong really, I can't actually remember my playthrough properly (me and some friends took turns playing on my PC) but I just seem to remember seeing lots of different words and attachments/abilities/skills/perks whatever you want to call them!



# **Conclusion**

Anyway, there's my mini review of the Beta I _might_ purchase it but definitely not on release. It just doesn't feel special enough with WarFace around the corner and a bunch of other games that just interest me more. But overall, it's a fun game and I'll probably end up getting it when my friends get it to play online.
