I've wanted to do this for ages, ever since I made a quick video of a [submarine script challenge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0RTE9cB2dk) I wanted to make some "Speedcoding" videos which would comprise of a bit of coding, testing and the final product working fully at the end. [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0QsfYUd_xA] I love the concept of Speedart, although I'm not really at any level of Photoshop or Maya skills that I think people would find entertaining, however I do consider myself rather experienced in the Pawn language after so many years working on SA:MP! So I think I will start recording more coding+testing features such as new items so people can get an insight into my workflow, or even coding workflows in general! If you're reading this and you like the idea, let me know!
