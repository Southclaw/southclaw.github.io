Today, I was offered the chance to give feedback to Facebook through a survey option that appeared on the page, here's a summary of what I wrote and how I feel about the product in it's current state: I feel facebook is improving, but it still feels outdated interface wise compared to an interface like Google, YouTube or even GitHub. It feels slow and sluggish at times (not all the time) aside from this, I have a handful of good and bad thoughts on the site... ![](https://www.facebook.com/images/fb_icon_325x325.png)

# Chat

The biggest problem that stands out to me right now is the chat feature, I REALLY miss the lists feature but I understand why it was removed. The biggest issue with the friends list at the moment is that it seems to try and predict who I talk to the most, yet I see people on that list that I barely talk to yet the people I DO want to talk to aren't on there. Maybe there should be a "Show in chat list" option (again, right click actions would help a lot here) for friends, so I can remove all the people I don't talk to and just leave my best buddies there ready to talk to. I mainly use Facebook for chatting anyway and spend a lot of my time actually in the messaging page. 

# Interface

I feel the interface is very outdated, I've noticed changes to my timeline but those changes haven't taken effect on the newsfeed yet (I barely use the timeline, looking at my own profile the majority of the time seems a bit narcissistic) I really think the site could benefit from context-click (right mouse button) support, like Google does. So I can simply right click a person's name to bring up a set of options instead of hovering and waiting for the menu to appear. The wait is mostly fine and I probably sound really impatient here but it really becomes noticeable if you want to perform a batch of operations on a group of people/pages. 

# Newsfeed Filter

I also wish there was a way to disable certain newsfeed item types (game requests) not just individual games or individual people but ALL posts relating to one thing (facebook games!) this way I can filter out all text based posts, or all link posts or all youtube posts or all photo uploads etc etc. Effectively a "newsfeed filter" that I can customise that saves the setting over sessions. 

# Customisation

Lastly, customisation. I understand the need for consistency in design choices and I'm not asking for the ability to completely change the blue to yellow (the blue is really the Facebook brand colour now) but I really would love to just drag-and-drop to re-order the items on the left side (favourites, groups, pages, apps, etc) half of the things in that list I don't even use (page feed, like pages, create advert, developer, apps) I don't see why there is the ability to "Add to favourites" but not "Hide". I am happy that I can give feedback to facebook, I feel it's difficult to contact developers here as there's no central forum for discussions or feedback but that's understandable really. I hope more of these surveys are conducted in the future as this really is a consumer driven product, if a social network doesn't listen to the community that drives it, it may as well not exist! Anyway, rant over, facebook is a good platform I just find it a bit **static**, **clunky** and **slow** at times!
