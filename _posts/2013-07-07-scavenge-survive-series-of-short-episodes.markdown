I've finally got around to getting this organised and ready! In the alpha test, me and my friend Tezza recorded 5 short videos outlining some of the base mechanics and gameplay. But that was ages ago and there are hundreds of new features in the game now! It's time to update the media side of Scavenge and Survive! ![](http://i.imgur.com/aI7iGavh.jpg) You can find the old "Alpha Test Adventures" series [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YiqgtVW2i0&list=PL401006D77205DF96&index=21), there's even a blooper video! There weren't many players playing at that time as I was hosting it from my own network with a dynamic IP address. There are some good scenes though, mostly outlining bandits, vehicle mechanics, weapons and item looting. Since then, a lot of things have improved including the UI (the UI in the video is just placeholder debug stuff) and it mainly took place in San Fierro as that was the only place where items could be found! I had a few positive responses from the last video and some requests to do more, well now it's finally happening!
